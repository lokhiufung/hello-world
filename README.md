# hello-world
my first github repository
I am a fresh learner in machine learning, and I want to have a deep understanding on how the neural network models work. Therefore, I created page to store my algorithms. 


I will some script about neural-network here, from linear regression model via gradient descent to multi-layer network. 
There is an issuse that I haven't figured out why. I have create a simple classification data set to test my algorithm. I have used the data set to test the logistic model and i found that it works perfectly. However, when I use the same data set to test the two layer model, the two layer model doesn't work. The cost keep increasing with number of iteration. I suspected the reason is one of the following:
1. i haven't normalised the data before i use it.
2. problem with learning rate
3. bugs in my alogorithm, but i have checked it many times...

I have proved that man should never underestimate his power to make stupid mistakes... 
The problem is related to the global variables and local variables inside the functions. I have mixed them up.
